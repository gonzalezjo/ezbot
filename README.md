# ezbot
A bot that generates solo-race tracks for TypeRacer, where races should be somewhat easier.



Some things to note: I used this to mess around with the `httpclient` Incubator Module. That might mess with things if you try to use it. I pretty much gave up on tests or good design, since the obfuscated nature of GWT code generation made this painful enough. Because it plays as a guest, its tracks will not be as easy as they will be for account based ezbots.
